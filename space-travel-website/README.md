### What I learned

In this challenge I use Kevin Powell's tutorial in scrimba.
In general, I learned that we can work faster and more consistent if we set up a design system upfront.
Especially if the project is large enough.

There are a lot of css functions and properties that I never used before such as `grid-template-areas` and `clamp`.
`grid-template-areas` can help the css we wrote easier to read and visualize.
`clamp` function help us to do responsive design easier since we can limit the maximum and minimum size of an element, while keep it responsive with its middle value.

The tutorial also emphasize a lot about how we need to design the website also for keyboard users and keeping accessibility in mind.


### Continued development

The site may be able to improved further by separating the tab contents into separate file and source it.
