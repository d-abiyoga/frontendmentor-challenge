## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- uuid - JS library
- react-swipeable  

### What I learned

This challenge is a quite hard since I introduced with UI components I never built before. I learned how to build lightbox and carousel.I also try to be more concious to accessibility and keyboard users who may use keyboard only in the carousel.

I learned to use React props to implement the functionality of toggler and cart items. 

I use react-swipeable to accomodate swipe in carousel which is a common user behavior in mobile version.

### Continued development

The code may be refactored after I learned more React hooks which may make cleaner code such as useContext.

Better lazy-loading may also be applied in further improvement.
