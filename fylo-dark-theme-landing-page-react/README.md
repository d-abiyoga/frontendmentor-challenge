## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS with mixins
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to use font-awesome through npm package. 
I think this is a better way than using svg from the font-awesome website.

I learned how to setup style assets and utilise SaSS functions and mixins which makes the style assets better organized.

I also mix use of CSS grid and flex especially in the footer section. 
In my opinion for a more complex positioning use case, grid is more logical to use. 

### Continued development

I would like to implement testing in my future project. 
I tried to implement in this challenge but it seems I need to learn more about how testing-library for react is used.

My current solution is using React only for separation of component, but it does not implement any props yet.
I hope I can make a better use of props in my future project/challenge. 

### Useful resources

- [Codercoder Project Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI0BfXFjI1I&t=354s) - I use SaSS setup and mixins from codercoder video. It help me a lot to better understanding how to use mixins and functions in SaSS.
